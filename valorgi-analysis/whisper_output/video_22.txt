If an airplane is about to crash for any reason, it's almost impossible for the passengers
on board to survive.
Whether it's business class or economy, passengers are not given parachutes.
This is the reason over 100,000 people have lost their lives in plane crashes so far.
But now, this could soon change.
As an engineering team is working on detachable airplane technology, in this design, the airplane
will be structured in such a way that in any emergency situation, the passenger section
will detach from the rest of the plane.
After this, with the help of two advanced parachutes, the passenger cabin can be safely
landed on any water or land surface.
In this way, passengers will be able to survive without any harm.
