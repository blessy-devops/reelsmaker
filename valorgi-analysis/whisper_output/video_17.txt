In 1951, a man named William Alby invented a type of tire that could easily move on any surface.
Even if these tires are installed on a truck weighing several thousand kilograms
and driven over a person, that person would remain unharmed.
This is because due to the low-pressure tires, the vehicle's entire weight is distributed over a
large area so the person underneath the tire remains unharmed.
These low-pressure tires are so remarkable that only a force of two kilograms is exerted at each point.
They were primarily invented to move on soft and weak surfaces like snow,
and they are also known today as roligant tires.
