This jacket nearly cost the company millions.
A woman named Jen got caught in a heavy rain storm while wearing her branded North Face jacket,
the one that was supposed to be waterproof.
But it soaked through completely.
Jen posted an emotional video saying,
Listen, I don't want to rehearse. I want you to redesign this raincoat to make it waterproof
and express the livery about to the top of hooker valley lake in New Zealand,
where I will be able to do it.
The video quickly went viral, but the most impressive part, the company's response.
Instead of panicking, North Face turned the situation to their advantage.
They took one of their newest waterproof jackets, rented a helicopter,
and had a staff member deliver it to Jen in person on top of a mountain before she left.
Jen was stunned, and the internet loved it.
The moral of the story, when your reputation is on the line, don't get emotional,
act fast and solve the problem.
