Have you ever wondered what would happen if you trusted God completely?
George Miller did just that.
He opened orphanages for over 10,000 children in England,
but here's the amazing part.
He never asked anyone for money.
He prayed, only prayed, and trusted God to provide.
One morning there was no food for the children.
Mueller gathered them at the table and began to pray,
thanking God for the meal that wasn't there yet.
Suddenly there was a knock at the door.
A local baker stood outside with fresh bread.
He said, I couldn't sleep last night.
I felt like God wanted me to bake this for you.
As if that wasn't enough, moments later a milk cart broke down
right in front of the orphanage, giving them all the milk they needed.
George Miller's life was a living testimony of God's provision.
He proved that when you trust in God fully, miracles happen.
What will you trust God for today?
