You'll never guess how some Swiss people get home from work.
Every summer and burn commuting takes on a whole new meaning.
When the weather gets warm, locals jump into the air.
The city's crystal clear river and let the current carry them home.
Their clothes and belongings are packed into waterproof floating bags that drift
alongside them as they go.
It's not just a way to get home.
It's a refreshing escape from the daily grind and a chance to see the city
from a whole new perspective.
So, ready to visit Switzerland?
