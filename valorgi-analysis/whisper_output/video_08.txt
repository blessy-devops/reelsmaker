For realities you must come to understand.
1. Anger is the part of yourself that loves you the most.
It knows when you are being mistreated and neglected or disrespected.
It signals that you must take a step out of a place that doesn't do you any justice.
2. Anything that annoys you is teaching you patience.
Anyone who abandons you is teaching you how to be independent.
Anything that angers you is teaching you forgiveness.
Try to think of everything as a learning experience.
That's how you grow.
3. A person in two months can make you feel what a person in two years couldn't.
Time means nothing and character means everything.
4. Accept people as they are but place them where they belong.
You are the CEO of your life.
Higher, fire and promote accordingly.
