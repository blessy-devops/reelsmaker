Did you know that octopus's die after giving birth to their babies?
These intelligent animals only breed once in their lifetime.
After mating, a female finds a rocky den and lays more than 100,000 eggs.
It takes six to eight months for them to fully develop.
She carefully positions her 100,000 eggs along the rocky ceiling of her den.
By this time, she has already lost most of her body weight and all her rich red color.
She hasn't eaten or left her den for the past six months, and she is slowly dying.
During the last few months, she must force water over her eggs with a siphon,
providing them with oxygen and keeping them free of harmful bacteria and algae.
After ten months of struggle, she gives life to thousands of young octopuses,
which swim to the surface, carried by the cold water currents.
This shows the incredible wisdom of God's design, where everything in creation has a purpose.
True sacrifice means giving everything for the future, trusting that our actions will bring
new life and opportunities for others. If you're not following Valergy, you're probably never
going to see us again. If you are, then congratulations. You're growing every day.
