She's 19, speaks more than 10 languages, and is next in line for the Spanish throne.
Her royal highness, Leonor, officially known as the Princess of Asturias,
has already demonstrated at a young age that she has what it takes to become Spain's future queen.
When Leonor takes the throne, she'll become the first reigning queen of Spain in the last 150 years,
and only the second in the country's history.
Currently, she's wrapping up a rigorous three-year training program at the General Military Academy of Zaragoza,
which includes Stints in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
In addition to her native Spanish, Leonor speaks English, French, Chinese, Arabic, and Portuguese,
and is also fluent in all of Spain's regional official languages.
