What happens if a frog is suddenly put into a pot of boiling water, it will immediately
decide, this is uncomfortable, I need to get out of here fast, and jump right out.
But what if you take that same frog, put it in a pot of cold water, place it on the stove,
and gradually heat it up, the frog will relax.
It will notice that it's getting warmer, but it will think a little extra warmth won't
hurt.
Eventually, it ends up getting boiled.
Many things in life accumulate gradually, debts, excess weight, and poor health.
Don't underestimate the little things.
