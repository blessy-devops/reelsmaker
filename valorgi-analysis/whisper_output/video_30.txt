When God wanted to create fish, he spoke to the sea.
When God wanted to create trees, he spoke to the earth.
But when God wanted to create man, he turned to himself.
Then God said, let us make man in our image and in our likeness.
If you take a fish out of water, it will die.
And when you remove a tree from soil, it will also die.
Likewise, when man is disconnected from God, he dies.
God is our natural environment.
We were created to live in his presence,
because it is only in him that life exists.
Let us stay connected to God.
Let us remember that water without fish is still water.
But fish without water is nothing.
The soil without a tree is still soil.
But the tree without soil is nothing.
God without man is still God.
But man without God is nothing.
