What happens when the biggest creature on Earth Blue Whale dies?
It is said that Blue Whale realizes it's impending death.
That's why it goes hundreds of kilometers away from its nest and makes the last dive of its life with all its strength.
And as soon as it dives, whale dives straight into the depths of the sea.
This is also called whale fall.
First, Blue Whale's body is eaten by sharks and eels.
For many days after that, the little bit of flesh that is left is eaten by small worms.
After that, there are zombie worms that secrete acid onto the whale's bones,
breaking them down and releasing fats and proteins.
These fats and proteins are also eaten by symbiotic bacteria, which live with zombie worms.
And when these bones melt, it serves as nutrients for the plants that grow in the water.
This process goes on for about 100 years.
The whale ends its life and keeps about 43 species and over 12,490 organisms alive.
That's why it is said that when the whale dies, it gives life to hundreds of creatures.
This shows the incredible wisdom of God's design.
Nothing is wasted and everything in creation has a purpose.
Every detail of nature is part of God's perfect design.
