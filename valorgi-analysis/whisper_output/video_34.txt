This girl dipped her hand into the same kind of water that sank the Titanic and lasted only 40 seconds.
It turns out that the Titanic Museum, located in Missouri, USA, has a chilling exhibit where visitors can experience what the passengers felt that night.
The water is kept at the exact same temperature it was during the sinking, minus two degrees Celsius, cold enough to cause hypothermia in just minutes.
That's what claimed the lives of over 1,500 people who felt that cold themselves that morning.
The museum is famous for recreating the Titanic's interior in full scale, along with several original artifacts, including the icy water exhibit.
Most people can't even keep their hands in it for 20 seconds.
This museum makes you truly reflect on the courage and desperation those people experienced.
