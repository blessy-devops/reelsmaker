five signs that she is a wife material. Number one, she advises you not to waste your money,
not even on her, but to invest it into something that would guarantee the both of you a future.
Number two, she wants a peaceful relationship. She doesn't fancy nagging you,
as well as she doesn't fancy you playing games with her. Number three, she considers your loss her
and your failure, her failure. She is deeply sad when you fail at your goals. Number four,
she stays with you in any situation both bad or good. Anybody can love and treasure you
when things are fine. Any woman can help you spend your money when you have it,
but the woman who sticks with you when you don't have any is good. Number five,
you can cry in front of her and be confident that she won't think less of you ever.
