In 1994 Japanese scientist Dr. Masaru Emoto proved something extraordinary.
Your words physically changed the world around you.
Dr. Emoto had students speak negative words like
I hate you and you're a failure to one set of water bottles.
Another set was treated with kind, loving words like
I love you and thank you. After freezing the water and viewing it under a
microscope the results were astonishing. The water exposed to negativity
formed chaotic distorted patterns. Meanwhile the water blessed with positivity
crystallized into breathtaking harmonious shapes. Here's the mind blowing part
over 70% of your body is water. That means every word you speak
creates a ripple effect in your cells shaping your energy health and even your
reality. Speak love, speak gratitude,
speak power into your life. Death and life are in the power of the
tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.
