One day Albert Einstein was teaching a class and wrote on the board
9 times 1 equals 9
9 times 2 equals 18
and he continued all the way up to 9 times 10 equals 91
The class broke out in laughter because Einstein made a mistake
The correct answer to 9 times 10 is obviously 90, not 91
and the students began to make fun of him
Einstein waited for everyone to be silent and then said
despite the fact that I analyzed 9 problems correctly
no one congratulated me but when I made one mistake
everyone started laughing this means that even if a person is successful
society will notice even the slightest mistake
so today's reminder to you is that mistakes are a part of the process
as Einstein once said the only person who never makes a mistake
is someone who does nothing
if you're not following biology you're probably never going to see us again
if you are then congratulations you're growing every day
