Once LeCost did something unthinkable, they gave up their iconic crocodile logo, and it
became the boldest campaign the brand had launched in 85 years.
The crocodile had always been the symbol of LeCost Polo shirts, but in 2018, during Paris
Fashion Week, the company made a shocking move.
They removed it, but why?
LeCost wanted to draw attention to the problem of endangered species.
For the first time in history, the brand replaced its famous crocodile with 10 different
logos, each depicting a threatened animal.
Here's the brilliant part.
The number of polo shirts made for each animal matched the exact number of individuals
left in the wild.
Only 1,775 shirts were produced.
They sold out instantly, and all proceeds went to wildlife conservation.
