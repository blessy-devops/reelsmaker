## Transcrição Completa

This is the only place in the world where time doesn't exist.
Sumeroy, a hidden gem of the coast of Norway, is unlike anywhere else on Earth.
Located above the Arctic Circle, this island experiences 69 days of uninterrupted daylight in summer,
and long stretches of darkness and winter.
In 2019, the islanders captured global attention with their playful idea of abandoning the traditional 24-hours clock.
Though it was a clever tourism campaign, the concept reflects how the 300 residents live unbound by time.
Locals can be seen playing football, swimming, or hiking in the middle of the night,
taking full advantage of the midnight sun.
With clear skies, pristine waters, colorful homes, and the magical northern lights and winter,
Sumeroy offers a life-free from the pressures of a daily schedule.
It's a place where time becomes irrelevant, making it the perfect escape for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with nature.
