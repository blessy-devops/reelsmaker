## Transcrição Completa

During the war in Japan, a young boy was carrying his deceased brother on his back,
with intent to give him a proper burial. A soldier saw him and told him he should let go of the burden
so he can save energy, but the boy replied, he's not heavy, he's my brother.
The soldier understood this and was moved to tears. This single moment became a symbol of unity in Japan.
So, Valerie G. Family, let this be our motto. He's not heavy, he's my brother, she's my sister.
If family stumbles, lift them up, even if you grow tired, lend a hand. When mistakes happen,
show forgiveness, and if the world turns away, carry them, because they are not heavy, they are family.
