Here are eight rules to not screw up your daughter.
One, let her feel her emotions,
don't invalidate them, shame them, or try to fix them.
Two, love her mother well.
Your relationship is the model for how she will expect a woman to be treated.
Three, never underestimate the importance of a girl's father.
Four, take every opportunity to tell her that she is enough.
She is heading into a world designed to convince her that she isn't.
Five, when she wants your attention, give it to her.
Don't give her any reason to question whether she's worthy of her father's attention.
Six, pursue her heart, be interested in what she cares about,
ask her questions, and listen when she talks.
Seven, learn to speak the language of emotion.
Your logic means nothing when she's upset.
Eight, accept that sometimes just listening is the solution.
Your problem-solving brain will thank you, and so will your daughter.
The mission of Valorgy is to inspire and improve people's lives.
Join us on our journey.
