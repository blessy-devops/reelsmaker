## Transcrição Completa

What if instead of dropping bombs from planes, governments dropped these black balls?
The world could change. In Kenya, millions of these balls are distributed every year.
Kids launch them with slingshots, tourists drop them from planes, and people toss them as they walk.
Why? Because inside each ball is a tree seed, wrapped in a special protective coating.
This coating keeps birds and animals from eating the seed.
Once the ball hits the ground and rain falls on it, the coating dissolves and the seed begins to sprout.
Thanks to this simple idea, thousands of acres of dry land can become green and full of life once again.
