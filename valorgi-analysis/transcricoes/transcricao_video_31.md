## Transcrição Completa

The founder of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid, was once asked about the future of his country.
He replied,
My grandfather wrote a camel.
My father wrote a camel.
I drive a Mercedes.
My son drives a Land Rover.
And my grandson is going to drive a Land Rover.
But my great-grandson will ride a camel again.
When asked why he explained,
Hard times create strong men.
Strong men create easy times.
Easy times create weak men.
And weak men create hard times.
Many won't understand this.
But you must raise warriors, not parasites.
History proves it.
The Persians, the Trojans, the Egyptians,
the Greeks, the Romans,
and later the British.
All great empires,
rose and collapse.
Not because of external enemies,
but because they rotted from within.
If you're not following Valergy,
you're probably never going to see us again.
If you are, then congratulations.
You're growing every day.
