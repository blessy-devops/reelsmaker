## Transcrição Completa

Olaf once said,
Healing is weird.
Some days you're okay and you're doing just fine.
Other days it still hurts like it's fresh.
It's a process with no definitive time frame.
You just have to keep going and know that when all is said and done,
you're going to be okay.
You're going to make it okay here.
I trust you.
Picture healing like a roller coaster.
Some days you're on the high, feeling good and steady.
Other days it's like a dip.
The pain is back.
But here's the thing.
It's a journey with a lot of twists.
But you have to take steps forward.
On those rough days, be kind to yourself.
Imagine each step is a victory even the small ones.
Healing is a messy masterpiece and time is its paintbrush.
Keep going.
When all is said and done, you'll look back and see how far you've come.
The mission of Valorgy is to inspire and improve people's lives.
Join us on our journey.
