## Transcrição Completa

He never touches other women, even in photos, always keeping his distance.
Fans around the world have noticed one intriguing detail in photos featuring Lionel Messi.
When posing with men, he easily puts an arm around their shoulder, smiling and appearing
completely at ease. But when there's a woman beside him, he always maintains clear distance.
Hands at his sides are in his pockets. Body slightly turned away, and absolutely no touching.
When asked about this habit, Messi replied simply and sincerely,
I respect women, but I also respect my wife. Even a harmless photo could lead to misunderstandings
with his wife. He recognizes that, especially in today's social media era, anything can be taken
out of context. And he refuses to risk his reputation or family trust. Messi and his wife and
Tonella have known each other since childhood. And he frequently emphasizes that family is
his greatest priority. In a world where many celebrities see their relationships crumble
under the pressure of rumors and scandals, Messi makes every effort to avoid even the slightest
cause for misunderstanding. He's not only a genius on the field. He's an example of a man who
truly cherishes what matters most. If you're not following Valergy, you're probably never going
to see us again. If you are then congratulations, you're growing every day.
