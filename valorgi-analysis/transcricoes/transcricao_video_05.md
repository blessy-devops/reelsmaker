## Transcrição Completa

The only bird that dares to peck an eagle is the crow.
The crow sits on the eagle's back and bites his neck.
The eagle does not respond, nor fights with the crow.
He doesn't spend time or energy on the crow.
Instead, he just opens his wings and begins to rise higher
in the heavens.
The higher the flight, the harder it is for the crow to breathe.
And eventually, the crow falls off due to a lack of oxygen.
Learn from the eagle, and don't fight the crow's.
Just keep ascending.
They might be along for the ride, but they'll soon fall off.
Do not allow yourself to succumb to the distractions.
Keep your focus on the things above and continue rising.
If you're not following the Velorgy Project,
you're probably never going to see us again.
If you are, then congratulations.
You're growing every day.
