## Transcrição Completa

On January 12th, 2007, a mysterious violinist played for 45 minutes on the New York subway.
A few people stopped, a few clapped, and the violinist racked up about a $30 tip.
No one knows this, but the violinist is one of the best musicians in the world.
In that subway, he played one of the most complex works ever written with a $3.5 million violin.
Two days before, he sold out 2,000 tickets in a theater in Boston and seats averaged about $100.
He was paid $1,000 by the organizers for each minute of the performance.
Joshua Bell is the violinist in the story, one of the world's greatest violinists.
Listen to this, a bottle of water can be 50 cents at a supermarket, $2 at the gym, $3 at the cinema,
and $6 on an airplane, same as in the experiment above.
The only thing that changed its value was the place.
So the next time you feel your worth is nothing, maybe you're in the wrong place.
Remember this, go to where you are appreciated, and go to a place that understands your value.
