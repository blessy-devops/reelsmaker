top three rarest eye colors in the world. Number three, Hazel. Hazel eyes are quite rare,
characterized by a combination of colors, typically including shades of brown,
green and gold. They represent about 5% of the world's population,
making them the third rarest eye color globally. The unique aspect of hazel eyes
is that they can appear to change color based on lighting and surroundings,
which adds to their allure. Number two, Gray. Gray eyes are the second rarest eye color,
found in less than 3% of the global population. They are most commonly seen in northern and central
European countries, such as Iceland, Finland and Norway. People with gray eyes are often
perceived as intelligent and profound. Number one, Green. Green eyes are quite fascinating
in the rarest. They are the result of a combination of reflected light and low levels of
melanin in the iris, which means there's no actual green pigmentation in the eye. Only
about 2% of the world's population has green eyes, making it the rarest eye color.
