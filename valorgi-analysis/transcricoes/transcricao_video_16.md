## Transcrição Completa

A giant ship's engine broke down, and no one could repair it, so they hired a mechanical
engineer with over 30 years of experience.
The engineer inspected the engine very carefully from top to bottom.
After seeing everything, the engineer unloaded his bag, pulled out a small hammer, and gently
knocked a mechanical part.
Shortly after, the engine roared back to life.
A week later, the engineer mentioned to the ship owner that the total cost of repairing
the giant ship was $20,000.
The owner couldn't believe it and immediately requested a detailed invoice.
The answer is very simple.
The tap with a hammer costs $2, knowing where to knock and how much to knock costs $19,998.
The moral of the story, recognize the value of one's expertise and experience as they
are the culmination of many years of hardships.
If I do a job in 30 minutes, I spent 20 years learning how to do that in 30 minutes,
and therefore you owe me for the years, not for the minutes.
We post interesting and instructive stories, follow us to keep track of our account.
