## Transcrição Completa

In 1983, at the start of one of the world's toughest ultra-marathons, a 540-mile trek from Sydney to Melbourne,
a farmer showed up dressed in overalls and galoshes.
When reporters asked who he was, he replied that his name was Cliff Young.
He was 61 years old and often ran for three days straight while chasing sheep on his farm.
So he was confident he could run the five days needed to cover the distance.
Other participants were elite runners from around the world, sponsored by major sports brands, most of them under 30.
Runners typically ran for 18 hours and slept for six to cover the distance.
However, it was discovered the day after the race started, that Cliff Young had run through the entire night without sleeping.
Five days, 15 hours and four minutes later, he finished first in this grueling race, beating his nearest competitor by 10 hours.
He admitted he didn't even know runners could sleep during the race.
Cliff declined the $10,000 prize money and shared it among the next five runners who finished after him.
He became an Australian national hero and an ultra marathon icon, exemplifying how determination, perseverance and unconventional thinking can overcome any physical challenge.
