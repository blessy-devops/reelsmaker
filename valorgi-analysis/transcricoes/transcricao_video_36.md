## Transcrição Completa

Today, the whole world knows this car, but did you know that Rolls Royce was born out of a remarkable coincidence?
Henry Royce was born into a poor family and worked wherever he could as a child,
selling newspapers, carrying sacks, fixing wires.
But later, he began building his own car, and he actually managed to start it.
It was noisy, it broke down often, but he was obsessed with quality.
He wasn't trying to build a car for everyone.
He was building the perfect one.
His motto, strive for perfection and everything.
Take the best that exists and make it better.
One day, his car caught the eye of Charles Rolls, a wealthy aristocrat and race car driver.
After driving it, Rolls said,
this is the best car I've ever driven.
That's how Rolls Royce was born.
The union of a poor engineer and a rich dreamer.
Years later, Rolls Royce became a supplier to the royal family,
and to this day, the brand remains a symbol of flawless taste and timeless elegance.
Rolls Royce isn't about speed.
It's about silence in which your presence speaks for itself.
If you're not following Valergy, you're probably never going to see us again.
If you are, then congratulations.
You're growing every day.
