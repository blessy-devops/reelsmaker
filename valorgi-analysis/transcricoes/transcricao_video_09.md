## Transcrição Completa

There are only three types of people in your life.
First are the leaf people.
These are people who come into your life just for a season.
You shouldn't depend on the leaf people because they are weak.
Second are the branch people.
They are stronger but you still need to be careful with them.
They break away when life becomes tough and can't handle too much weight.
They may stay with you for some seasons but they will break away when it comes harder.
Number three, root people.
These people are very important because they don't do things to be seen.
They are support and even if you go through a difficult time, they will water you.
They aren't moved by your position.
They love you just the way you are.
If you're not following Valergy, you're probably never going to see us again.
If you are, then congratulations.
You're growing every day.
