Did you know that in Singapore trash disappears without a trace and recycled plastic bottles are used to make some of the world's best roads?
Singapore is a country of the future where there is virtually no waste.
Here, plastic bottles are transformed into excellent road materials.
In Singapore, all waste is disposed of in just one day.
Every day, over 2000 trucks collect all the garbage and transport it to a bunker.
Across the country, there are four waste incineration plants where waste is burned to generate electricity used in residential homes and other buildings nationwide.
The toxic smoke is filtered out and becomes super clean.
The ash remaining after burning is mixed with cement to produce bricks.
As for plastics, a Singaporean company recycles them into a material that completely replaces traditional fishermen in road construction.
